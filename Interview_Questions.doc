RADISYS :


Pl pepare on C/Data structures/ Linux OS concents/ IPCs. Below are some guideline questions.

C / Linux system programming Questions:

6. Design an algo for the following
input queue = 2,4,6,5,1,9,8,7,3
two threads, one is even and the other is odd. 
Even thread should read even values and odd thread should read odd values and print them in the same order as the input queue.
7. What is memory leak, and how can you find a memory leak without using a tool in linux environment.
8. How to debug core dump?
9. How to find the address of a data type in a structure variable?
10. Write a program to insert a node from linked list?

struct s
{
char a;
int b;
}o;
sizeof(o);
why padding is required ? where it will be ?
memory alignment
struct s
{
char a;
int b;
char hh;
}o;
sizeof(o);
Registers - memory layout
doubly linklist deletion of node:
check no of bits set in char.. 
little endian big endian
socket , bind and connect
raw socket
static dynamic library , what is libpthread static / 
conditional compilation
make file, how to give flag at compile time -DTILE / for undefine 
what is hash table ?, data structure used for implementation of hash table

1. Memory Layout of a Process (Text segment, DS segment, BSS segment, Stack, Heap).
2. Static and local variable(Differences).
3. Redefinition for a global variable(Error scenarios)
example:
a.c
int i=10; // global
b.c
int i = 8; // global
compiled to a.o and b.o, will through error while linking(type of error and why and how can we avoid the same).

4. Difference between process and thread(why thread is called light weight process).
5. Thread is having only it's own stack whereas text and data segment it will share of the parent process.
6. Binary semaphore and mutex(are they same?).
7. Delete a node from Link List(keeping all the 3 conditions in mind[delete first, last and middle]).
8. int value = 0x01020304; swap the 1st and 3rd byte
we can type cast with a char type pointer to store the bytes and than some string operation can be done to swap, there could be other ways too.
9. Sockets system calls
 socket, bind, listen, select .
 Do we need to provide the IP of server for socket creation in server.
 accept as blocking call, can it be made NON_BLOCKING.

10. Ping protocol(ICMP packets will be visible in Wireshark and what are the other fields and loop back address) 11. How can we debug a core dumps and how core dumps are getting generated in linux(it was not about the compile time flag, more of about the mechanism[may be the memory image of the call stack generations]).
